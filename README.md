# Digital Image Processing - E9 241

> DIP E9 241 Aug 2025 My mini-Projects and Notes for Digital Image Processing

## Repo Structure 
I will try to write up a very very short latex note on lecture with implementation of any interesting algorithms or methods discussed in class 

### structure :
I am not following the exact lecture numbers rather I will be following topics as lectures 

book is compiled to [notes/maha-dip-notes.pdf](./notes/maha-dip-notes.pdf) in this repo

folder [notes](./notes/) contains subfolders for individual lectures with some implementations, each lecture folder follows 
lec_<No>

|-- tex file : Notes

|-- ipynb: implement and details 

|-- any other files (readme in that folder) or the assets used for notes or in ipynb notebooks

Topics :
---
1. Binary Image Processing
2. Gray Scale Image Processing
3. Frequency Domain Processing
4. Image Restoration
5. Image Features
